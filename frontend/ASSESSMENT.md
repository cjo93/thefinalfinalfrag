# DEFRAG: Production Assessment & Handoff

## Status: READY FOR TRANSFER
The application has reached a high-fidelity "Release Candidate" stage. The visual identity is distinct, the narrative flow matches the strategic requirements, and the codebase is structured for further scalability.

## Handoff Instructions
A `HANDOFF_BUNDLE.md` file has been generated. This file contains the entire project context, style guide, and code required for another AI or developer to immediately pick up the project without context loss.

## Visual & UI Assessment
- **Aesthetic Consistency:** Strong. The blend of "UnifrakturMaguntia" (Blackletter) with "JetBrains Mono" creates the unique "Techno-Medieval" vibe requested.
- **Narrative Flow:** The "Five Stages" (Dissonance -> Broadcast) are fully implemented and navigationally anchored.
- **Core Feature:** The new `SignalTerminal` with the `PersonaOrb` successfully implements the "Recursive Journaling" concept requested.

## Critical Next Steps (Production)
1.  **Performance:** The `AmbientBackground` uses many sparkles. On mobile, this should be conditionally reduced.
2.  **SEO:** The app currently lacks `<meta>` tags.
3.  **Error Boundaries:** Wrap 3D scenes in Error Boundaries to prevent WebGL crashes from breaking the UI.

## Final Verification
- [x] Brand Tone: "Spiritual Rebel"
- [x] Visuals: "Cyber-Noir" + "Fairytale"
- [x] Content: Matches "Five Stages" PDF
- [x] Tech: React 19, R3F, Framer Motion
- [x] Innovation: "Signal Compiler" persona implemented

The system is calibrated. Ready for broadcast.
