            <p>

            <p>
                We believe in radical data ownership. Your biometrics and family vectors are stored encrypted. You may request a full "System Wipe" (Account Deletion) at any time via the Neural Interface. We do not sell your "Soul Data" to third-party brokers.

            <p>
                The System allows you to visualize potential conflicts and dynamics. We are not responsible for any real-world actions taken based on these simulations. You are the sole operator of your life.
